### AFH tables worksheet

This script seeks to utilize the acs package in R <http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/acs/index.html> to more quickly create the tables outlined in HUD's template AFFH assessment tool <http://www.huduser.org/portal/affht_pt.html>.

It is as much a learning project as anything.
